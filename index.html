				Hello, my name is Nidal Ghonaim. I was born in <span class="secondary">1996</span>. I got my first computer somewhere around <span class="secondary">2007</span>. In my second year in high school, a teacher asked for somebody who could build a class blog. I've been in love with the web ever since.
				<br><br>
				I started my journey in web development by making custom blogger themes somewhere around <span class="secondary">2012</span>. Later I started teaching myself HTML, CSS, & Javascript. In the year <span class="secondary">2014</span>, I transitioned into game development & joined a small indie team -named Funktion- comprised of some highschool friends. I dedicated <span class="secondary">2015</span> to learning 3D modeling with Maya. And in <span class="secondary">2017</span> I allocated more time to teaching myself computer science online.
				<br><br>
				In <span class="secondary">2018</span> I started my first year at Cardiff Metropolitan University. My graduation date is in <span class="secondary">2021</span> for a bachelor's degree in business management (IBM). On my own time, I learned to program in PHP using Laravel & Ruby using Ruby on Rails.
				<br><br>
				Despite my business major, my passion is programming & graphic design. I want to build a career in programming & designing web pages & apps (preferably in Ruby).
